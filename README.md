# Data Visualization in Python: Seaborn

If you are doing your data analysis in pandas, seaborn is the perfect data visualization companion. Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib (see session on 2/12), but focuses on a dataset-oriented interface. Its high-level interface lets you create complex, multi-layered graphics, while still retaining all of the low-level customization and output options provided by matplotlib. With a focus on statistical visualizations, seaborn’s elegant and minimal interface can greatly speed up your exploratory data analysis, prototyping, or the preparation of professional-looking visualizations for your research paper!

### Requirements

To get the most out of this session, you need some basic experience with Python, and ideally the pandas library. This workshop is also a perfect follow-up for [“Data Visualization in Python: Matplotlib”](https://git.dartmouth.edu/lib-digital-strategies/RDS/workshops/computational-tools/data-viz-matplotlib). The contents are designed to be very beginner-friendly, however. Consider working through [Intro to Python](https://git.dartmouth.edu/lib-digital-strategies/RDS/workshops/computational-tools/intro-to-python) prior to this workshop.

The requirements for the Python code can be installed using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
